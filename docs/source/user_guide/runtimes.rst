Runtimes for Custom Devices
========================================

.. note::

   This documentation is intended for those implementing the own device backend for PPE training framework.
   Most users can just skip this chapter.

The :class:`ppe.runtime.BaseRuntime <pytorch_pfn_extras.runtime.BaseRuntime>` API is in charge of abstracting the device details
and performing the movement of data and modules to the corresponding device.

A runtime is an object that defines multiple callbacks used
through the training, evaluation, and regular model calls.
With runtimes, we can implement training in devices other than cpus or gpus
with minimal changes to the user code.

Users wanting to override only a few callbacks can inherit from
:class:`ppe.runtime.PyTorchRuntime <pytorch_pfn_extras.runtime.PyTorchRuntime>` which implements the basic functionality for cpu and
gpu devices.

Runtimes must be registered by calling the
``ppe.runtime.runtime_registry.register(device_name, runtime_class)`` function
for them to be discoverable.

Use of ``ppe.to`` to transfer modules and batches to custom devices
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have defined a new runtime for a custom device the ``ppe.to`` function
allows moving a module or a tensor to the new device by invoking the
``Runtime.move_tensor`` and ``Runtime.move_module`` when needed.

The module will be tagged by adding a attribute named
``_ppe_runtime`` that holds the needed runtime. It is the responsibility of the
user custom runtime to perform the actual movement to the device and apply
all the transformations needed to a module so it can be correctly executed.

Usually, runtime writers will need to replace the given module forward function
by a new one that performs the actual device execution.

.. code:: py

    class MyModule(torch.nn.Module):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.layer = torch.nn.Linear(10, 10)

        def forward(x):
            return self.layer(x)

    class MyMagicDeviceRuntime(ppe.runtime.BaseRuntime):
        def _device_forward(self, args):
            return run_batch_in_my_device(args):

        def move_module(self, module):
            # Registers a hook to initialize the module on the first batch
            # execution
            def hook(module, *args):
                module._ppe_runtime.initialize_module(module, args)

            self.hook = module.register_forward_pre_hook(hook)
            # Change the module forward to do the computation in the device
            module.forward = self._device_forward

        def initialize_module(self, module, loader_or_batch, optimizer=None):
            create_the_module_in_my_device(module, loader_or_batch, optimizer) 

    # Register the runtime class
    ppe.runtime.runtime_registry.register('my_device', MyMagicDeviceRuntime)

    # Create a regular module
    module = MyModule()
    # Move the module to the device
    ppe.to(module, device='my_device')

    for x in my_dataloader:
        # The first iteration will create the module in the device
        # and the next ones will directly execute the module in the device instead
        # of executing the regular pytorch `forward` call.
        y = model(x)

Please note that this is an oversimplified description and that developing a
runtime that is 100% compatible with PyTorch requires to wrap the substitute
forward function with ``torch.autograd.Function`` among several other concerns
such as ``state_dict`` manipulation to ensure correcteness.

Runtime Registry
-------------------

When creating a new ``Runtime`` class for custom needs, they need to be registered
in a global ``runtime_registry`` object as detailed above.
This object is of the ``_RuntimeRegistry`` type and it maintains a map of strings and
``Runtime`` types. The keys are the devices passed to ``ppe.to`` and the
types will be the type of the ``Runtime`` object that ``ppe.to`` will use to treat the
module or tensor. Beware that users are not supposed to interact directly with this class, only
with the ``runtime_registry.register`` to register new runtimes.
